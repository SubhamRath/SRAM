# SRAM
Design of a ultra LV 6T full CMOS SRAM (1k x 32bit) using open souce memory compiler OpenRAM using SCIMOS Technology
# What is SRAM ?
-Static random-access memory is a type of random-access memory that uses latching circuitry to store each bit. SRAM is volatile memory; data is lost when power is removed. The term static differentiates SRAM from DRAM which must be periodically refreshed.
-The data storage cell, i.e., the 1-bit memory cell in static RAM arrays, invariably
consists of a simple latch circuit with two stable operating points (states). Depending on
the preserved state of the two-inverter latch circuit, the data being held in the memory cel
will be interpreted either as a logic "0" or as a logic " 1." To access (read and write) the
data contained in the memory cell via the bit line, we need at least one switch, which is
controlled by the corresponding word line, i.e., the row address selection signal. Usually, two complementary access switches consisting of nMOS pass transistors are implemented to connect the 1-bit SRAM cell to the complementary bitlines (columns). This can be likened to turning the car steering wheel with both left and right hands in complementary directions.
